# Customer Churn Prediction System

## Overview
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) or not. 

### Goals:
- Predict customer churn using historical data.
- Understand the key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Help the business reduce churn by identifying potential churners and addressing their concerns.

## Dataset
- Source: [Mention the data source, e.g., Kaggle, company database, etc.]
- Features:
    - Customer ID
    - Demographic Information (age, gender, etc.)
    - Subscription Duration
    - Account Activity
    - Payment History
    - Support Ticket Records
    - Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges
    - Churn (Target Variable: Yes/No)
- Number of records: [Insert record count]

## Project Steps
1. Data Exploration
    - Load and explore the dataset.
    - Visualize the distribution of churned and non-churned customers.
    - Perform correlation analysis to identify the relationship between variables.
  
2. Data Preprocessing
    - Handling missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract type).
    - Feature scaling (for continuous variables).
    - Train-test split of data.

3. Feature Engineering
    - Create new features (e.g., tenure groups, interaction terms).
    - Selection of important features using statistical tests or feature importance scores.
  
4. Model Selection
    - Models considered:
        - Logistic Regression
        - Decision Trees
        - Random Forest
        - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
        - Support Vector Machines
        - Neural Networks (if applicable)
    - Evaluation Metrics:
        - Accuracy
        - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
        - ROC-AUC Curve

5. Model Training & Tuning
    - Train models on the training data.
    - Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search).
    - Compare performance metrics of models.
  
6. Model Evaluation
    - Evaluate model performance on the test dataset.
    - Generate confusion matrix, classification report, and AUC-ROC curve.
    - Select the best performing model.

7. Deployment
    - Deploy the model using [Streamlit, Flask, Django, etc.].
    - Create an interface for business users to upload new data and receive churn predictions.
  
## Results
- Best Model: [Model Name]
- Accuracy: [Accuracy Score]
- F1 Score: [F1 Score]
- Key Features Impacting Churn:
  1. Feature 1
  2. Feature 2
  3. Feature 3

## Conclusions
- Summarize the key takeaways from the model results.
- Recommend strategies to reduce churn based on the key features.
  
## Future Work
- Further improve the model by incorporating more data or advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Implement real-time churn prediction for ongoing business analysis.

## Libraries Used
- Data Processing: pandas, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Modeling: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras (if using neural networks)
- Deployment: Streamlit,Â Flask

# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over time. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models and identify the key factors influencing it. Through model validation, we select the model with the best accuracy to help businesses reduce churn and improve retention strategies.

## Goals
- Predict whether a customer will churn based on their historical data.
- Identify key features affecting churn.
- Perform model validation to achieve the best model accuracy.

## Dataset
- Source: [Data source, e.g., Kaggle, company data]
- Number of Records: [Insert record count]
- Features:
    - `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
    - `Demographics`: Age, gender, location.
    - `Account Information`: Tenure, subscription type, monthly charges.
    - `Customer Behavior`: Payment history, support tickets, service usage.
    - `Churn`: Target variable (Yes/No).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Perform descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
- Visualize key features and the distribution of `Churn` (target variable).

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, subscription type).
- Scale numerical features if necessary (e.g., `Tenure`, `Monthly Charges`).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn Distribution: Visualize how many customers churned.
- Feature Correlations: Examine correlations between independent features and churn.
- Feature Importance: Identify top features using visualizations (e.g., bar charts, correlation heatmaps).

### 4. Modeling
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
  - Support Vector Machines (optional)

### 5. Model Validation & Selection
- Cross-Validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold, 10-fold) on the training data to ensure robust model performance.
- Validation Metrics:
  - Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
  - Precision: Correctly predicted churners out of all predicted churners.
  - Recall: Correctly predicted churners out of all actual churners.
  - F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
  - ROC-AUC: Measures model's ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners.
  
- Model Tuning:
  - Apply Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
  - Evaluate models with tuned parameters and compare performance across different models.

### 6. Feature Importance
- Identify the most important features affecting customer churn using:
  - Feature importance from tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
  - Coefficients from Logistic Regression.

### 7. Final Model Evaluation
- After cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, select the best model based on validation metrics.
- Test the best model on the unseen test set to evaluate final performance.
- Metrics on the test set:
  - Test Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
  - AUC-ROC Curve: To assess the model's discriminative ability.

### 8. Results and Insights
- Summarize the performance of the final model.
- Discuss the top contributing factors to customer churn.
- Provide actionable insights for reducing churn (e.g., customers with high monthly charges or short tenure are more likely to churn).

## Conclusion
By implementing machine learning and thorough model validation, this project successfully predicts customer churn with high accuracy. The analysis helps businesses understand which factors drive churn and provides a basis for targeted interventions to retain customers.

## Future Work
- Incorporate advanced models such as deep learning or ensemble methods for further improvements.
- Conduct customer segmentation for personalized retention strategies.
- Implement real-time churn prediction.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning models and utilities.

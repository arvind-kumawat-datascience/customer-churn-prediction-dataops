    "# Customer Churn Prediction System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "- Predict customer churn using historical data.\n",
    "- Understand the key factors contributing to customer churn.\n",
    "- Help the business reduce churn by identifying potential churners and addressing their concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "- Source: [Mention the data source, e.g., Kaggle, company database, etc.]\n",
    "- Features:\n",
    "    - `Customer ID`\n",
    "    - `Demographic Information (age, gender, etc.)`\n",
    "    - `Subscription Duration`\n",
    "    - `Account Activity`\n",
    "    - `Payment History`\n",
    "    - `Support Ticket Records`\n",
    "    - `Tenure`, `Monthly Charges`, `Total Charges`\n",
    "    - `Churn` (Target Variable: Yes/No)\n",
    "- Number of records: [Insert record count]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Steps\n",
    "1. Data Exploration\n",
    "    - Load and explore the dataset.\n",
    "    - Visualize the distribution of churned and non-churned customers.\n",
    "    - Perform correlation analysis to identify the relationship between variables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "    - Handling missing values.\n",
    "    - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, contract type).\n",
    "    - Feature scaling (for continuous variables).\n",
    "    - Train-test split of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "    - Create new features (e.g., tenure groups, interaction terms).\n",
    "    - Selection of important features using statistical tests or feature importance scores.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Model Selection\n",
    "    - Models considered:\n",
    "        - Logistic Regression\n",
    "        - Decision Trees\n",
    "        - Random Forest\n",
    "        - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)\n",
    "        - Support Vector Machines\n",
    "        - Neural Networks (if applicable)\n",
    "    - Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "        - Accuracy\n",
    "        - Precision, Recall, F1 Score\n",
    "        - ROC-AUC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Training & Tuning\n",
    "    - Train models on the training data.\n",
    "    - Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search).\n",
    "    - Compare performance metrics of models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "6. Model Evaluation\n",
    "    - Evaluate model performance on the test dataset.\n",
    "    - Generate confusion matrix, classification report, and AUC-ROC curve.\n",
    "    - Select the best performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Deployment\n",
    "    - Deploy the model using [Streamlit, Flask, Django, etc.].\n",
    "    - Create an interface for business users to upload new data and receive churn predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Results\n",
